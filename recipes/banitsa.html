    <p>Banitsa is a traditional Bulgarian pastry dish made with layers of thin filo dough, eggs, and cheese, sometimes with added ingredients like spinach, yogurt, or minced meat. <br> Here's a recipe for classic banitsa:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 package of filo pastry sheets (about 16-20 sheets)
        </li>
        <li>
            8 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup plain yogurt
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups crumbled feta cheese (you can also use a mixture of feta and other cheeses like mozzarella or ricotta)
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            Optional: chopped fresh parsley or dill for added flavor
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions In Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a baking dish with butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs and plain yogurt together until well combined. Season with salt to taste. If using, mix in chopped fresh parsley or dill for added flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Unroll the filo pastry sheets on a clean work surface. Cover them with a damp towel to prevent them from drying out.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take one sheet of filo pastry and place it in the prepared baking dish, allowing the edges to hang over the sides. Brush the sheet lightly with melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the process with another sheet of filo pastry, laying it perpendicular to the first sheet in the baking dish. Brush it with melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Continue layering filo pastry sheets and brushing each layer with melted butter until you have used about half of the sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle half of the crumbled feta cheese evenly over the layered filo pastry sheets in the baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour half of the egg and yogurt mixture over the cheese layer, spreading it evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Continue layering the remaining filo pastry sheets on top of the cheese and egg mixture, brushing each layer with melted butter as before.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle the remaining crumbled feta cheese evenly over the top layer of filo pastry sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the remaining egg and yogurt mixture over the cheese layer, spreading it evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fold any overhanging edges of the filo pastry over the top to enclose the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Brush the top of the banitsa with the remaining melted butter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the banitsa in the preheated oven for about 40-45 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crispy and the filling is set.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once baked, remove the banitsa from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve the banitsa warm or at room temperature. Enjoy your delicious homemade banitsa!
