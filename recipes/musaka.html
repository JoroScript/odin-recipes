    <p>Moussaka is a delicious dish with layers of eggplant, potatoes, minced meat, and a <br>creamy béchamel sauce, popular in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines.Here's a basic recipe:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 large eggplants, sliced lengthwise
        </li>
        <li>
            2 large potatoes, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 lb (450g) ground lamb or beef (you can also use a mixture of both)
        </li>
        <li>
            1 onion, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>
            1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon dried oregano
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon dried basil
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            Olive oil for frying
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions In Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt the eggplant slices and let them sit for about 20-30 minutes to draw out excess moisture. Then, rinse them and pat them dry with paper towels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat some olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the eggplant slices until they are lightly browned on both sides. Remove them from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed and sauté the chopped onion and minced garlic until softened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the diced tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the flavors meld together and the sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook for a couple of minutes until it's lightly golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Cook the sauce until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season the béchamel sauce with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now it's time to layer the moussaka! In a greased baking dish, arrange a layer of potato slices at the bottom, followed by a layer of eggplant slices.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the meat mixture over the eggplant layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the béchamel sauce over the meat layer, spreading it evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the moussaka in the preheated oven for about 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Allow the moussaka to cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your delicious homemade moussaka!
