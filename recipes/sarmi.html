        Sarmi, also known as Sarma, is a traditional dish in various Balkan and Middle Eastern countries, consisting of rolled cabbage or grape  leaves filled <br> with a savory mixture typically containing rice and ground meat. Here's a recipe for cabbage rolls, one of the most common variations of sarmi:
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            1 lb (450g) ground beef or a mixture of beef and pork

        </li>
        <li>
            1 onion, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cloves garlic, minced
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 cup chopped parsley
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon dried thyme
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon paprika
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons tomato paste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cups beef or vegetable broth
        </li>
        <li>
            Olive oil for cooking
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions In Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
         Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully add the whole head of cabbage to the boiling water and cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the outer leaves are softened. Remove the cabbage from the water and let it cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl, combine the rinsed rice, ground meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, dried thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are evenly distributed.        </li>
        <li>
            Carefully separate the softened cabbage leaves, trimming away the thick center rib if necessary to make them easier to roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a spoonful of the meat and rice mixture onto each cabbage leaf, near the base. Roll the leaf tightly around the filling, tucking in the sides as you roll, to form a neat cylinder. Repeat with the remaining cabbage leaves and filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Arrange the cabbage rolls seam side down in the skillet, fitting them snugly together.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small bowl, mix together the tomato paste and diced tomatoes. Pour this mixture over the cabbage rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the beef or vegetable broth into the skillet until it almost covers the cabbage rolls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the skillet and simmer the cabbage rolls over low heat for about 45-60 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the cabbage is tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, prepare the sauce. In another skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until softened.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the crushed tomatoes, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the cabbage rolls are cooked, serve them hot with the tomato sauce spooned over the top. Enjoy your delicious homemade sarmi!
